        <h1>Sloper Only Sessions</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>While it may sound silly, sloper only sessions can boost your proficiency with them a ton. Many people
            struggle with slopers, and they continue to struggle with them because they avoid them and don't practice
            them enough. Sloper only sessions, or focusing on slopers for a solid amount of your
            workout can give you the time needed to learn how to use these holds better and gain more experience with
            them.</p>

        <h2>Suggested Pre-Req</h2>
        <p>When practicing slopers for your session, you must make sure you know how to effectively climb them. Before
            your session I recommend reading and reviewing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Beginners: <a class="link" href="/train/lessons/intro-slopers.html">Intro to Slopers</a></li>

                    Contact and
                    Friction on Slopers</a></li>

                    Engagement</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How To</h2>
        <p>After or while warming up, start by scouting for sloper holds and climbs. If your gym is limited but has a
            scrapboard or digital board with sloper holds you can also use that. Once you have a few climbs that are
            your flash level and below as well as on-level or project, you can start.</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Sloper-Only Climbing</h3>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Climb on slopers to familiarize yourself with them while practicing principles
                such as: how to grip and use them, maximizing surface contact and friction, and engaging your shoulders.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> On each of the routes selected, varying from flash to on-level, to maybe
                project.</p>
            <i>Note that you may not be ready for using slopers in project-level grades due to not being familiar with
                them as you are with other hold types in your project grade. Start easy and work your way up.</i>
        </div>
        <p>Make sure you are paying special attention to the techniques you need to be using (as seen in the pre-req
            articles) to get the most out of these holds. The goal isn't to send your hardest climb, but to familiarize
            yourself more with slopers.</p>
        <div id="tipsContainer">
            <h2>Progression Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Start easy at flash grade or lower and work your way up. It may take time to start climbing slopers
                    at your project grade.</li>
                <li>Make sure to use proper technique, even on easier climbs. While you may be able to get away on those
                    climbs, you won't be able to as you progress so it is vital to learn correctly the first time.</li>
                <li>Even experienced climbers can use this activity to focus on slopers, because many people's struggle
                    is them and a little extra attention can never hurt.</li>
