        <h1>Movement Learning & Practice</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In climbing, and many other things, their are 3 stages of learning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cognitive</strong>: You need to actively think about the skill to preform it and can find basic
                applications for the skill likely in the flash level or below.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Diversification</strong>: You will reconize more oppurtunities to preform the skill more easily
                likely in your normal climbing or below.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Autonomous</strong>: You will almost or truly automatically do it in applicable scenarios in
                redpoint and project attempts. The technique is now close to - or is - muscle memory.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One cannot learn a skill and immediately take it into their practice in their most challenging climbing
            attempts or even through on-level attempts. Your body needs time to go through the 3 stages (cognitive,
            diversification, and finally autonomous) over time and different stages of practice. These stages of
            practice are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>General Paterning (Cognitive)</strong>: Low intensity applying the technique to the easiest of
                problems to get a feel for it. Your attention shouldn't be on the route your climbing but on the new
                technique your applying. This stage can take minutes (for easy concepts like silent-feet) or days (for
                more advanced concepts like turning and drop knees).</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Basic Application (Diversification)</strong>: Still low intensity, likely flash level, where you
                practice the skill and apply it to slightly harder problems.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Submaximal Application (Diversification)</strong>: Medium intensity again at your flash or even
                on-level if comfortable. At this point you are trying to apply the technique to unique wall angles, hold
                types, and types of problems (ex: endurance, big moves).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Applying the Stages to Climbing Technique</h2>
        <p>Now that we more deeply understand the 3 stages of learning: cognitive, diversification, and autonomous, as
            well as the 4 stages of practice: general paterning, basic application, submaximal application, and
            performance application, we can apply them when learning a new technique. For the sake of this lesson, we
            are going to be learning how to foot swap.</p>

            <tr>

        <h3>Step 1: Learn</h3>
        <p>Before we can even jump on a wall, we must understand the technique we are trying to apply to our climbing.
            This means searching up the technique (foot swapping in this case) and watching a video or reading a lesson.
            Only once we understand how to do it can we begin applying it to basic climbing.</p>
        <h3>Step 2: General Paterning</h3>
        <p>Now that we better understand the technique, we can apply it to very basic climbing. This climbing should be
            below flash level and probably some of the easiest climbs in your gym. For example, to learn foot swapping,
            I would go on a V0 or V1 and simply practice swapping my feet at the start holds. Only once I am very
            comfortable applying the technique to the most basic of climbing would I then move up.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Basic Application</h3>
        <p>Now, I will start to find climbs at my flash level or (ideally) below for foot swapping, I will try to apply
            it to easy climbs such as V2s or V3s. The climb still shouldn't give you much trouble and your main focus
            should be correctly applying your technique.</p>
        <h3>Step 4: Submaximal Application</h3>
        <p>Congrats!</p>

            <h2>Notes & Tips:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Applying a technique at V2 can look very different than at V4, thus slow progression. While the
                    basic pattern may be the same on the V2 & V4, the reconizing of when to apply it and how to apply it
                    will be different.</li>
