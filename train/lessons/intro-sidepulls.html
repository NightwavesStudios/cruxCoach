        <h1>Intro to Sidepulls</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Sidepulls are a common hold type that requires more than just hand strength — they demand body positioning,
            tension, and a solid understanding of directionality. This lesson introduces the mechanics of sidepulling
            and how to use them efficiently. We’ll cover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a sidepull?</li>
            <li>How to recognize and approach them</li>
            <li>Body positioning and common mistakes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is a Sidepull?</h2>
        <p>A sidepull is a hold that faces sideways and is ineffective — or impossible — to pull down on vertically.
            Instead, climbers must generate lateral pulling force, often while leaning their body away from the hold.
            Proper use of a sidepull involves activating your opposing muscles and keeping your body close to the wall
            while pulling inward.</p>

        <h2>Recognizing and Using Sidepulls</h2>
        <p>
            [Image - Sidepull Hold Example]
            <br><br>
            Sidepulls are typically vertical or angled edges that face left or right. When you see a hold you can’t pull
            down on but *might* pull across your body, it’s probably a sidepull. Key strategies include:
        <ul>
            <li>Using the hold with the opposite-side hand (e.g., right hold, left side of body pulls away)</li>
            <li>Leaning your body away from the hold to generate pulling tension</li>
            <li>Pressing your feet in the opposite direction to create counterforce</li>
        </ul>
        Sidepulls are often paired with flagging or high steps to create usable body tension. They become easier with
        precision rather than power.
        </p>

        <h2>Body Position and Technique</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Counterpressure is key.</strong> If you’re slipping off a sidepull, you’re probably not applying
            pressure in the right direction or your feet aren't counterbalancing the force. Here are key components of
            good sidepull technique:
            <br><br>
            <strong>Opposition with the Feet</strong> – Your feet need to push in the opposite direction of your pulling
            hand. A common technique is a high step on the same side as the pulling hand, combined with a flag on the
            opposite foot.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Core Engagement</strong> – Keep your core tight and hips close to the wall. Letting your body swing
            out defeats the leverage needed to hold a sidepull.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Elbow Direction</strong> – Keep your elbow close and pull in toward your torso rather than flaring
            it out. Think of using your lats and obliques rather than just your biceps.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Dynamic Movement</strong> – If you're moving between two sidepulls, controlled dynamic movement can
            help. Stay centered as you transition or else you risk barndooring off the wall.

            <h2>Quick Tips:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Always scan for footholds that let you oppose the direction of pull. Without opposition, sidepulls
                    are nearly useless.</li>
                <li>If you're barndooring, try flagging or switching feet to rebalance your center of gravity.</li>
                <li>Practice sidepulls on vertical walls before trying them on overhangs, where tension and body
                    position become much harder.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Sidepulls challenge your ability to use technique and body tension rather than brute strength. To use them
            effectively, learn how to identify their directional nature, set your feet to oppose the pull, and stay
            tight through your core. With deliberate practice, sidepulls become tools rather than obstacles.</p>
