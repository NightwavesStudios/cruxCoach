        <h1>Intro to Underclings</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Underclings are one of the more unintuitive grips in climbing — you’re pulling upward on a hold that points
            down. They demand trust in your feet, body tension, and a good sense of movement direction. This guide will
            help you understand how to recognize and effectively use underclings. We’ll cover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is an undercling?</li>
            <li>How to approach and use underclings</li>
            <li>Common technique, footwork, and mistakes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is an Undercling?</h2>
        <p>An undercling is a climbing hold that faces downward, usually below chest level, which is pulled on by
            applying upward force. Instead of pulling down like with most holds, your fingers curl underneath the hold,
            and you push against it by pulling up while pressing down with your feet. Underclings are all about
            opposition — your hands pull one way while your feet and body resist the motion.</p>

        <h2>Using Underclings Effectively</h2>
        <p>

            <br><br>
            When approaching an undercling, the key is to lower your body to create tension between your feet and the
            hold. Think about "sitting" into the hold and pushing with your legs as much as pulling with your arms.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drop your hips below the hold to maximize leverage</li>
            <li>Place your feet high to generate opposition force</li>
            <li>Use underclings to stabilize while moving up or laterally, not just to pull upward</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most underclings are not usable in isolation — they work best when paired with good footwork and a plan to
            move into a stronger grip above.</p>

        <h2>Body Position and Technique</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Lowering Your Center of Gravity</strong> – Keep your hips below your hands when using an undercling.
            This creates the tension needed to keep the hold usable and allows your feet to do most of the work.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Foot Pressure</strong> – Unlike crimps or sidepulls, underclings rely heavily on your legs. Push
            into footholds to drive your body upward. Smearing and edging can both be useful depending on wall angle.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Hand Position</strong> – Your fingers should wrap under the hold and pull up toward your chest.
            Keep your elbows low and bent — if your arms are fully extended, you’re probably not getting usable tension.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Movement Strategy</strong> – Use underclings as intermediate holds that support movement into a more
            secure position. Often, underclings are transitional — great for gaining elevation or stabilizing, but not
            long-term resting points.

            <h2>Quick Tips:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If you're slipping off an undercling, you're probably not applying enough downward foot pressure.
                </li>
                <li>Use high feet or smear to generate counterforce when holds are too low for traditional steps.</li>
                <li>Pair underclings with compression when available — use an opposing handhold to create force from
                    both sides.</li>
                <li>Look for opportunities to convert underclings into mantles or reach-throughs — they often lead to
                    big upward moves.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Underclings force you to think differently about how you climb. They rely on technique, foot pressure, and
            balance — not just pulling strength. Mastering underclings can open up sequences that look impossible at
            first glance. Focus on dropping your hips, pressing with your legs, and moving smoothly through the hold to
            the next one.</p>
