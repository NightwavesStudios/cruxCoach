        <h1>Intro to Overhangs</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Overhangs — angles steeper than 110° — demand more than strength. They test your ability to move with
            tension, conserve energy, and use every part of your body efficiently. This lesson covers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What defines an overhang and why it matters</li>
            <li>Key movement strategies to fight pump</li>
            <li>Common traps and how to avoid them</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is Overhang Climbing?</h2>
        <p>When a wall leans significantly past vertical — usually between 110° and 130° — the climbing gets steep fast.
            Gravity feels like it’s pulling you straight off the wall, and holds often become larger but more spaced
            out. Efficient climbing here is about tension, pacing, and precision, not just muscling through.</p>

        <h2>Movement and Tension</h2>
        <p>

            <br><br>
            On steep terrain, body tension becomes your foundation. Core, hips, shoulders, and legs all work together:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep the Chain Tight:</strong> Engage your midline — your arms shouldn’t work alone. Visualize
                your body as one locked unit moving together.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient Feet:</strong> High feet matter. Bring toes up aggressively to keep hips under you and
                minimize swinging.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Knees and Heels:</strong> Drop knees, high steps, heel hooks, and toe hooks aren't tricks —
                they’re required tools to rest and stabilize.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every movement should reduce load on your arms. Even when dynamic, stay tight and deliberate.</p>

        <h2>Climbing Smart, Not Just Hard</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Rest When You Can</strong> – Overhangs often have "active" rests: heel hooks, kneebars, or stances
            where one arm can recover. Use them.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Breathe With Rhythm</strong> – Shallow breathing leads to panic. Sync breath with movement to
            regulate energy output.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Read Ahead</strong> – Poor planning leads to mid-sequence burnout. Spot rests, cruxes, and clipping
            stances before you leave the ground.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Dial in Pace</strong> – Go too fast and you’ll burn out; too slow and you’ll pump out. Find a flow
            where you stay controlled but don’t linger.
            <br><br>

            <h2>Quick Tips:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use heel hooks and toe hooks to relieve arm load and stabilize movement.</li>
                <li>Keep elbows down and tight — chicken-winging wastes energy and pulls you off the wall.</li>
                <li>Learn to shake out mid-sequence. Even 3 seconds can reset your arms for the next moves.</li>
                <li>Practice overhangs on auto-belay or short boulders to build power-endurance safely.</li>
                <li>If you're swinging or flailing, reset your feet — footwork controls body position, even here.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Overhangs amplify everything: fatigue, poor technique, and mental clutter. But they also reward disciplined,
            intelligent movement. Climbing steep isn’t just for the strong — it’s for the efficient. Focus on tension,
            economy of motion, and using your entire body. Get those right, and the steepest routes will start to feel
            possible.</p>
