        <h1>Silent Feet</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Silent feet is a simple practice that can help the first-day climbers as well as the advanced and world class
            climber. A simple exercise you can incorporate in your climbing and focus on in your warmups, it helps
            develop a better sense of precision with your footwork, and mitigate wasting energy through the constant
            readgustment of the feet.</p>

        <h2>How To</h2>
        <p>The idea of silent feet is to make your foot placements as precise and silent as you can. This means, soft,
            well thought out foot placement. You know you are properly following this exercise when not only can you not
            hear the placement of your feet, but when you no longer have to readjust them in any way. When first
            starting out with silent feet, try incorporating it into your warmup:</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Warmup Silent Feet</h3>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Place feet quietly and precisely to not need to readjust them and not be able to
                hear them.</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> On Every route of your warmup.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Practicing it in your climbs warmup is an easy way to practice silent feet. Once you feel good with doing it
            in your warmups (maybe it even feels automatic or natural) you can try using it in your climbing. Again, it
            is the same idea of silent, precise foot placements, just on harder and more on-level climbs.</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Silent Feet</h3>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Place feet quietly and precisely to not need to readjust them and not be able to
                hear
                them.</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> On Every route of your warmup.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>The Ultimate Goal</h2>
        <p>After incorporating silent feet into your warmup and every-day climbing, you may be wondering, what is this
            doing for my climbing? At first, silent feet helps you place your feet more proactively. This conserves
            energy and improves your stability on
            the wall. Then, as your practice more
            and more the goal is for you to start less proactively placing your feet in the "silent feet way" (precise,
            silently) and doing it more naturally, just like how you naturally flag or naturally grab a hold a certain
            way.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>While this exercise may not seem important as a beginner, or pointless ("because you're too good for it") as
            a
            intermediate or advanced climber, it can help you conserve energy that their is no reason to waste through
            constant adjustments and make your climbing flow better.</p>

            <h2>Progression Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Start by using it during your climbing part of your warmups, or whenever your doing easier routes at
                    flash/onsight or easier.</li>
                <li>Once you feel comfortable and automatic with this technique, incorporate it into your regular
                    climbing and slowly make it muscle-memory.</li>
            </ul>
