        <h1>Intro to Crimps</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Crimping is a fundamental skill that can make a significant difference in your climbing performance. Learning
            how to use various crimp positions and techniques effectively is essential to progress in climbing.
            Throughout
            the overview, we’ll cover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a crimp grip</li>
            <li>The three most common grips</li>
            <li>Body position and technique while crimping</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Crimping Explained</h2>
        <p>The crimp grip is characterized by an extension of the joints in the finger and sometimes the support of the
            thumb over them or to the side. This will cause the hand to appear crimped or folded. When utilizing the
            crimp
            grip, your fingers should be bent at approximately a 90-degree angle, creating a strong force against the
            hold.
            However, this may vary depending on the type and situation (discussed below). Proper finger positioning is
            crucial for maximizing strength and minimizing injury. However, there are multiple ways to crimp. The four
            most
            commonly used are the open crimp, half crimp, and closed crimp.</p>
        <h2>Open, Half, and Closed Crimps: What’s the Difference?</h2>
        <p>[Image - Open Crimp]
            <br><br>
            <strong>Open Crimp</strong> - A grip where your fingers tendons are more engaged at a 90 degree angle but
            still not all the
            way
            up and fully engaged. The thumb is still not active and not contributing to the grip. This grip position is
            best
            for easy crimps that need little to no force. It can also be used for resting during a route.
            <br><br>
            [Image - Half Crimp]
            <br><br>
            <strong>Half Crimp</strong> - The half crimp is the most common and versatile crimp. It consists of your
            finger tendons being
            engaged at a 90 degree angle. However, unlike the open crimp, the tendons will be more engaged and the thumb
            will also be playing a part by being either on the side of the hold or pressed against the wall for
            additional
            balance. This crimp is used for most crimping scenarios where you want to get the most out of the hold
            without
            risking injury or wasting energy through an aggressive closed crimp.
            <br><br>
            [Image - Closed Crimp]
            <br><br>
            <strong>Closed Crimp</strong> - The closed crimp is the most aggressive type of grip where the tendons are
            >90 degrees and
            often
            fully stretched. The thumb is either on the side of the hold or being used to hold down the gripping
            fingers.
            This grip is used on extremely small holds when maximum force is required.
        </p>

            <h2>Quick Tips:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Closed crimps can cause excessive stress on your fingers, especially with new climbers, and should
                    be used cautiously and sparingly.</li>
                <li>When training closed crimps, a climber should slowly build up their strength through drills that get
                    progressively harder. If it doesn't feel hard, it's still okay.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>In all of these positions, it is essential to engage other parts of your body other than your fingers. Your
            body’s position plays a crucial role in how effectively you can utilize your crimp grip.</p>
        <h2>Crimping Tips for Bouldering & Roped Efficiency</h2>
        <p>Low Center of Gravity - Keeping your hips low helps distribute your weight evenly and reduces the load on
            your
            fingers. Engage your core muscles to achieve stability and counterbalance the weight of your upper body.
            <br><br>
            Foot Placement - Good footwork is vital for maintaining body position. Place your feet strategically to
            enhance
            your reach and reduce strain on your hands. Good foot placements will allow you to push through your legs
            rather
            than relying solely on your upper body and hands. When placing your feet, you should try to align your hips
            above your feet, and keep your center of gravity close to the wall and lower. Furthermore, if you need to
            pull a
            certain direction away from the hold, use your feet to shift your center of gravity in the way you will need
            to
            pull.
            <br><br>
            [Image - Arrows for Pulling on Angled Crimps]
            <br><br>
            Dynamic Movement - When transitioning between holds, do so with controlled, deliberate movements. Avoid
            sudden
            jerks that can throw your body off balance and undermine your grip. Moving fluidly helps you use less of
            your
            energy and make seamless transitions from hold to hold.
            <br><br>
            Balance - While crimping, practice balancing your body weight between your hands and feet. Mastering body
            positioning and weight distribution is key to climbing efficiency. If you feel yourself barndooring while
            crimping, utilize flagging and smearing. Also, try to keep your body close to the wall to remove some of the
            stress from your grip and put it on your legs and feet.
        </p>
        <h2>Avoiding Injury While Crimping</h2>
        <p>Crimping is one of the highest-load positions in climbing — and also one of the easiest ways to damage your
            fingers
            if you're not careful. Tendons and pulleys, especially in your fingers, are under intense stress during
            crimping,
            particularly in the closed position. Overuse, poor warm-up habits, or incorrect technique can all contribute
            to
            common injuries like A2 pulley strains or flexor tendon inflammation.</p>
        <p>As a rule of thumb: if you're forcing a closed crimp on every route, you're setting yourself up for injury.
            Instead,
            use the open and half crimp where possible, and treat the closed crimp like a last-resort tool. Train
            progressively
            and listen to early warning signs—pain, stiffness, or swelling—before they become chronic problems. To learn

        <div id="tipsContainer">
            <h2>Crimp Injury Red Flags:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sharp or sudden finger pain:</strong> A strong indicator of tendon or pulley strain — stop
                    immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Swelling or inflammation around finger joints:</strong> Especially near the base of the
                    fingers;
                    don't ignore even mild swelling.</li>
                <li><strong>Popping or snapping sensations:</strong> Can signal a ruptured pulley — rest and consult a
                    specialist.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of grip strength or finger mobility:</strong> May point to early signs of tendon injury
                    or
                    nerve irritation.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent stiffness after climbing:</strong> Especially if it doesn’t resolve within a day
                    — could
                    indicate overuse.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Properly crimping is an essential technique for upping your climbing game and preventing injuries. You can
            utilize the open crimp, half crimp, and closed crimp for different crimps and situations.
            Furthermore, you can use dynamic movement, your center of gravity, and foot placement to maximize your
            efficiency while crimping.</p>
